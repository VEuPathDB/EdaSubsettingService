Review the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/example-jaxrs-container-service[Example JaxRS Container Service library] for notes on how to install and run this service

The primary datastore for the subsetting service is an RDBMS that includes the EDA schema.

Additionally, data is stored in compact binary files used by a high-efficiency map-reduce algorithm, to provide rapid response for large requests
